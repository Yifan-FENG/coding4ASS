And all in all, the HP universe works for me. Some movies are okay, some are good. Soundtrack was always great and I¬¥m fine with the special effects. Sadly, I can¬¥t say this about the Phantastic Beasts movie. <br /><br />It¬¥s lacking any higher level plot and the whole movie doesn¬¥t feel coherent. The soundtrack is almost imperceptible, the visual effects are worse than 2001 Lord of the Rings or 1999 Matrix and the characters are 100% one dimensional. Especially the rendering of the beasts was really bad and unconvincing. The number of scenes which were just annoying or didn¬¥t contribute anything to the plot were pretty high. <br /><br />Overall, it¬¥s a bad movie. Only made for a further cash up using the Potter lore. I hope there won¬¥t be a sequel to this and as a fan of the HP universe, I¬¥m exceedingly disappointed.",UCekmJuu9wznwoWeAiWpR9DA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekmJuu9wznwoWeAiWpR9DA,0,,,0.2057

The story is well done and gave enough information IMO. I don&#39;t always wanted to see war between wizards because these HP universe needs a lot of explanation rather than battles.

Though Fantastic beasts do have some fantastic beasts ,it leaves us very unsatisfied . They are some reasons we are so in love with Harry Potter and one of the main stonewalls is the developed storyline with detailed character introduction , coherent infrastructure and culminating finale. Many of you will deliberate that it is too soon to give any conclusion within the fact that it is the first installment of trilogy but the beginning has to capture the viewers and the main heroes are fail to do so. We are by all means are entertained by advanced special effects by it was not the crucial factor of so beloved Harry Potter. We are witnessing Eddie Redmayne trying on his new suit and he is so uncomfortable in it, it is actually disturbing. The whole production looks like overfilled suitcase of tricks not so coherent and organized .

I&#39;ve got to say I loved it! I liked that I didn&#39;t know much about it before (the trailers don&#39;t show too much). I&#39;d say it&#39;s more for adults than for kids. You don‚Äôt see that many jokes or goofy parts and there basically aren&#39;t any child characters. Well except few creepy ones... I really liked Dan Fogler, his character is amazing and loveable. Eddie Redmayne on the other hand isn&#39;t my cup of tea for this role. I&#39;d like to see someone else in that role but since I don&#39;t like to be too whiny, I tolerate him as Newt and maybe his character doesn&#39;t have to be the coolest and toughest one after all. There&#39;s this cool suprise towards the end which I really didn&#39;t expect. It&#39;s only few seconds, but it&#39;s nice. I&#39;d watch this movie again few times. There is no point of comparing it to the Harry Potter series since they are different stories / movies. <br /><br />I hope you liked it too!",UCg6SWx4VnAEGgO5upcVJcbw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg6SWx4VnAEGgO5upcVJcbw,0,,,0.9785

I'm not a crazy white male-hating narcissist, but I actually agree with some of the points Buzzfeed makes on why Harry isn't as great of a character as people make him out to be. Harry doesn't actually do anything, and he openly states that he's not looking for any trouble with anyone; trouble just steps up to him and wave obnoxiously. Harry never takes any risks and does something, he just waits for something to happen then react. And I know being in a closet for your entire life must suck and be terrible, but he can be pretty bratty at times. Although, enough about why I prefer everyone else over Harry; I might as well talk about Newt as the original comment also mentions him. There's just so many scenes that make me laugh. Okay, those scenes are supposed to be taken seriously or just be a regular scene with no comedic affect, but I just think of something related to the scene in my mind and I just start randomly laughing. Like when he was talking to Porpuetina about how broken MACUSA's are, I started thinking of Disney characters like Milan, Merida, or other free spirit clich√©s because the way Newt says it sounds so politically correct (which it is. I'm all for muggle-on-wizard/witch because of Snape) and kind've like an overused personality trait than a quote. Or the part at the bar where they meet the quote on quote, ""Goblin gangster,"" (dammit! Other than Gellert's hairstyle; I thought this film would actually know the basics of 1926-- just think of Marilyn Monroe, then think of what the year she was born was like. . there you go, you got your vision for 1926) and I started laughing because I thought that Newt was staring at Porpuetina's cleavage (probably was, to be honest. There's some shots that aren't right on her tits, but you can tell they want you to know it's there) while she was trying to talk.",UCaJe3zVXQjXG9SBRESrYdUw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaJe3zVXQjXG9SBRESrYdUw,1,UghYnGsNcdLwu3gCoAEC,ZukoHalliwell,0.9801

If you bothered to read my comment, you would've seen that I didn't really like the plot either. It's not a great storyline. However, when I saw the play, I forgot about the rubbish plot - the experience was truly magical. The acting was amazing, as well as all of the special effects. The script seemed bad because it was just a script. It had no description of anything, making it seem really boring. When I saw it, I felt as if I was at Hogwarts, experiencing all of their adventures with them. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!! Go and complain about HPCC somewhere else.

It is a play. So the plot is a bit over the top, but apart from that, it's not bad at all. Ever since I went to watch HPCC, my views on it have changed dramatically. I went from thinking that it was the worst thing ever written (that's a bit exaggerated üòÇ) to thinking that it's the best thing EVER! I will do anything to get my hands on more tickets. I am going to go again. I couldn't enjoy it fully because of some certain grumpy people in my family... But seriously people, it is AMAZING. Some of you were saying about how it skips long periods of time. It does that in the script. However, when I went to watch it, there were *loads* of scenes with no speaking at all. *Mild spoiler coming up* There was a very long scene with Albus and Scorpius after they had fallen out. It sounds quite boring, but it was really interesting. You have to remember that they can't put all the descriptions of the settings and stuff like that into the script. That's why the script seems so... bleh... Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you can't actually enjoy the Cursed Child fully if you haven't seen it in the Palace Theatre. Bam. That's the truth. I feel sorry for everyone who can't see it, but there isn't much that can be done. üò¢ ",UCDP23085ESr0Jr8F74DEALQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDP23085ESr0Jr8F74DEALQ,1,Uggt597LHYV9NngCoAEC,Dieselnaut,0.9049

It always uses the same dramatic tune that ends with a ping/crash like a sudden stop. I&#39;ve heard it so much that it feels so cliche. Have we reached the height of our creative powers as to reuse the same end of the world music over and over again for every movie that comes out?

I don't know how I feel about it... some parts were good with it, some, eh. Some intrusive or just out of place, or missing when I felt there should be something. That said, with the 3D and DBox... it did get me a couple times. The whole audience with or without DBox actually. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but, it's definitely a first intro chapter... it'll get even better I'm sure. Hopefully with more wizard world, and less political inferences, which didn't fit the time period which made it that more blatant... it was out of place, and took away from the film, to me anyway.

A large proportion of the Potter fan base was those children of a similar age who grew up with the actors/films as they came out. You cant beat that sort of connection of a fanbase to a film. The audience by the end of it would have been so connected that they felt the characters as friends etc. They also did use animatronics for some of the beasts in the potter films too such as buckbeak. This film will be good and i dont think its aim is or ever was to over throw what the Potter films became its more of an addition to the franchise for fans hungering for more wizarding goodness.,UCqY-uSbLKSXsGdDHEYOzqig,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqY-uSbLKSXsGdDHEYOzqig,1,UgiTQl3rCm_I2ngCoAEC,Merchant Ivory,0.8905

JK Rowling wrote this textbook as a companion book to the series (much like Dunk and Egg from a Song of Ice and Fire [Game of Thrones]) which was written in a non-fiction style while being fictional content. Basically what happened is, Harry Potter series finished but they wanted to make more movies, so JK Rowling wrote a completely new story for this movie (she wrote the script) and used a character from the background lore. This is a prequel that looks like its only slightly related to the Harry Potter series as a whole.

They shoulda used practical effects!&quot; Really? Really? Ok, CGI is not the bane of Christ or an instant movie killer. Quite the opposite really. It&#39;s a tool used to help make movies better and that&#39;s it. And like any tool it can be used and misused. One of the biggest things I see people complaining about in this movie is the CGI on the magical beasts. Keyword: magical. People, practical effects are great and can be used effectively, I will not deny that. But for goodness sakes, creating puppets for every single one of those creatures would cost so much money that it wouldn&#39;t even be funny. They probably wouldn&#39;t even be able to AFFORD the actors. Also, here&#39;s another reason using puppets for them wouldn&#39;t work: Range of motion. These things are flying, running, bending down, glowing, exploding, and doing a whole lot of other stuff that you just couldn&#39;t do with CGI. I mean, ever seen a puppet or animatronic in a movie run around with that range of motion? No, it moves its arms, limbs, and sometimes its torso. Rarely ever do you actually see them doing some of the crazy stuff these things are and will be doing. And for the record, yes, practical effects were used for some of the creatures in the Harry Potter movies, the basilisic being most notable. But ones like Buckbeak, Dobby, and the dragons were all clearly cgi and I don&#39;t see anyone complaining about THEM! So, do us all a favor and shut your mouths and wait to see how effective it is and stop blaming CGI for making a movie you haven&#39;t even seen yet the reason you hate it. Going &quot;Ugh, CGI, how lame&quot; is like going &quot;Ugh, a movie, how lame&quot;.

Version that I found is very good quality of video and sound (720p, I think). From what I've seen there are added French, Romanian and Dutch subtitles. Here is link to it above.

For all we know the trailers could be awesome but the movie a let down, like Avengers 2. BUT I'm not willing to base my entire judgement based off of the ""poor effects"" in the TRAILER. There's only¬†one way to know and that is to watch the movie for ourselves and decide then. I just don't like it when people begin judging something before it comes out because the think the effects in the trailer aren't that good. PLEASE! Show people in the¬†90s to early 2000's something like this they'll be blown away be the effects. But sadly, nowadays people come to expect that effects for PIECES OF FICTION be 100% realistic in its entirety and that the ""good old days"" of practical effects is where we should go.¬†Both CGI and practical effects¬†have their strengths and weakness. While certainly there are things that can be achieved using practical effects that can't be achieved with cgi the reverse is true.¬†Another thing that saddens me is that people are saying cgi¬†should be kept subtle and in the background. Even though we have things like Avatar, the MCU, Batman v Superman, and many more that can have things that are clearly computer generated but you don't care because¬†they're very good effects that are clearly in your face.¬†At the end of the day though, that shouldn't be your soul judgement on why you think a movie is bad. As if the effects are the ONLY thing that matter. Do characters, concepts, and plot mean nothing nowadays? Just because the effects aren't up to specs with your completely ridiculously high expectations doesn't mean it's any less of a good movie. You never want something perfect, because then there's nothing to talk about. Point is: don't judge something because of a single flaw you find in it. Look at everything you've seen as a whole and THEN make a judgement. But still go to see it anyways, because that's the only way you'll know for sure.",UCHSgrq1RAxitdaAZDT_ra-A,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSgrq1RAxitdaAZDT_ra-A,1,UggEyC9StgOgl3gCoAEC,Callian r,-0.9238

I don't mind the trailers that much for this movie, I'll go and see it just to see what could be done because of the lore that JK Rowling subsequently wrote after Harry Potter - of which there is a lot, so there's a story that could be told. The thing is we don't really need to see this as a film as it was never published in such a way that it could be adapted like other fantasy-style works, if the studios try stuff like this then OK, but as long as they don't make too much of a fuss over it because it has a different energy to HP. It could be very enjoyable, but it could also be very easily spoiled by too many wrong choices. I don't think it will be at all bad, I mean it couldn't be as weak as the Star Wars Prequels or as confused and over-stuffed as the Hobbit Trilogy, but Fantastic Beasts feels like an attempt to add a mythos and extra depth to a series that stands fine on it's own - this movie isn't going to make HP any better, but it may add something for the fans who want a spin off with effort and fidelity in it. It could be just fine compared to the others. So, in short, go and see this movie if you want and make your mind up afterwards. It's one third of a new series of prequels, basically. So if part one works for you, proceed and enjoy the next, otherwise you won't have to bother - that's what I'm going to do.",UCewNA7pCC5KAvoLB_U_C6Iw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewNA7pCC5KAvoLB_U_C6Iw,1,UgjqagX1XBCD8XgCoAEC,Ruaridh McGurk,0.9793

You can tell they're championing the fact that they own HP and are adapting the other material JK wrote, even just by the title card at the end playing the John Williams score. I haven't read this book yet (if you can call it that, it's so paper-thin), so there's not much of a story here at all, it'll just be a novelty of weird creatures with a tonne of call-backs to the Potter Movies, TONNES of excessive padding and fluff to make up for a sheer lack of depth and complexity compared to earlier works and characters that are expected to hold up to the ones in HP. All done as a corporate product that exists to appease fans and make Warner Bros. a tonne of cash.

First, I am not a female, nor a teenager, so your tumblr blog comment is wasted on me. I don't have a tumblr account, and if I ever did at any point in my life I wouldn't have had it for very long. Second, I know exactly what ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is, because I, like you, read the first Harry Potter book (imagine that!). I also read the real ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" which is a manifesto of magical creatures. I also know that the author of the fictional textbook that Harry, Ron, and Hermione use was written by Newt Scamander, who, as it turns out, happens to be the main protagonist of the movie, which is named after the book he wrote called ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"". Let's put these ingredients together and see if we can make any sense out of it all, shall we? We have the author of that book in the movie, we have the movie being centered around fantastic beasts, and we have a public who's only known link to Newt or to fantastic beasts is via a single name mentioned in one of the Harry Potter books. What is that name? ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"". Logically, it makes sense to name a movie about fantastic beasts (starring the author of ""Fantastic Beasts"") after the fictional book, since that is how most Harry Potter fans know this character and these beasts, yes? The pure fact that you called it the ""British police force"" tells me that you've done absolutely no research about this movie and are commenting based on first impressions alone. So let me shed some light on what this movie is about. Newt Scamander (author of the textbook ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" that Harry, Ron, and Hermione use at Hogwarts), visits New York City in 1926, decades before Harry is born. While he is there, he accidentally lets loose hundreds of magical beasts, and thus, the movie centers around him trying to collect the beasts before they wreak havoc on unsuspecting Muggles (No-Majs in America). Hope I've shed some light on this movie for you.",UCxfttcVlGJKHvoSQRa7jQ-Q,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfttcVlGJKHvoSQRa7jQ-Q,1,Ugg5N-Cd7AU4HHgCoAEC,Alex1514,0.9784

They actually designed much more terrifying visuals for Inferi but then later they stopped and said ""hold on, we're making children's movies. We cannot go that further."" Many of the films got PG-13 raiting but not because they really deserved that but because adult audience and film critics who didn't read the books take them seriously next to LOTR movies. Almost none of those PG-13 movies got really bloody or scary scenes while SW3 got a totally burned alive Anakin Skywalker. Just a few. We all know all of those books are much more scarier, bloodier, violent, adult oriented and action packed than those so-called PG-13 movies. They even didn't show Harry-Ginny and Hermione-Ron actually kissing in DH, for God's sake. Camera always looked at the other way while they were kissing as if the characters and audiences were little kids while the movies got PG-13 raiting. Embarrasing. So, Warner Bros. never targeted adult audiences in these films. They even took some of the most adult-themed books of the serie and turned them into children's movies. They never gave enough credit to books' real potential and never shot serious epic fantastic films like they deserved. They were always cowards not trusting children who read much more in the books wouldn't watch them at the screen as they were. And now this Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them seems like another children-teen movie with adult actors in the lead roles, not teen actors. That's all. Warner Bros. is what it is as always. Still milking the serie playing on teenagers with funny and childish adventures while much more adult-themed and serious, darker stories like Voldemort's and Dumbledore's past waiting on the shelf, dusting. Harry Potter universe can be wonderful and it still can be among the biggest three fantastic movie franchises but thanks to WB. who always insists on making children's-teen movies, they never will be considered as serious and magnificent as Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings.

Plus, the closer a story is to the original narrative, the more us fans will be irked if we feel like they're milking it. This at least has little to do with the original characters besides Grindelwald (I know I probably misspelled that). (And at least we know J.K. gives her profits away to good causes so I feel less bad about her milking HP than I do Lucas milking Star Wars.) Anyway. I also disgree that the filmmakers of the HP series cut the portions of the stories they did because they were trying to keep them light and happy for the kids. If they had done that, for one thing, they would have avoided those PG-13 ratings like the plague but they didn't. But those movies get dark, and they show the death of young people without a problem. They didn't make them to be kiddish. I think they cut stories like Voldemort and Dumbledore's back story because in film your time is limited and you have to be precise in your storytelling. Condensing Voldemort's story down to the scene in the orphanage I believe was a good decision. We saw that Voldemort: lacked the love of parents, family, grew up in a bad environment, lacked the proper attention, had already discovered his magic, was disturbed at a young age, and was using it against Muggles already. Other information we needed, Iike him being the heir of Slytherin, or that he'd commit murder as a boy, was given in other films. Dumbledore's story I admit they needed to show more of, but they gave enough information for someone like my dad who didn't read the books first not to get confused. I probably wrote an essay, but, well, I like film and storytelling. A lot of people don't think about film's limitations.",UCA4Gubl9N2MHzgI1EJV2U_A,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA4Gubl9N2MHzgI1EJV2U_A,1,UgiTHXa_5eGQTngCoAEC,EgemenUregen,0.8816

I have watched it and I must say I am fascinated. The best scene of film is from 43 to 49 minute, I have got goosebumps watching that! It will be the the best film lately made. Version that I found is decent good quality of video and sound (720p, but I'm not sure). From what I've seen there are available Dutch, French and German subtitles. I've watched it via upper link :) I hope it will help you, if it helped bump it if you've watched movie on this site :) Best wishes :)",UClANiDY97tT7M1gaoXIVtNQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClANiDY97tT7M1gaoXIVtNQ,1,UgiVMWXsKTCMPngCoAEC,nate mate,0.9903

There's something about practical effects within the Harry Potter movies that just make them better, it just looks better in some areas. Some of the effects aren't perfect, by any means, but the goblins look way better in practical effects than CGI for sure. I feel like the CGI and practical effects should continue to go hand in hand within the HP universe, not just be entirely CGI. Practical effects just add that special touch and that little bit of extra effort that makes it more enjoyable to watch and more immersive, which is ideal for a fantasy film. This is just my opinion, I like both CGI and practical effects.",UCIZvZyeT9_NBDRLfylXVgEg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIZvZyeT9_NBDRLfylXVgEg,1,UggY3GKD2RF4IHgCoAEC,Kurt Bauer,0.9773

I think these three films going to have major time jumps, sort of chronicling Scamander&#39;s life and exploits in a similar fashion to Indy Jones (except forward rather than Indy&#39;s backward chronology). I think this pic sets up and maybe in motion the forces that allow for Grindenwald&#39;s rise to power and eventually the world wizarding war that takes place basically concurrently with world war two. In other words, my guess is next movie takes place in the 1930s and the last film in the 40s, ending with Dumbledore&#39;s victory over his former friend (unrequited lover?) in 1945. Could make for a great and natural blending of the new characters and world in America with those we know and love from Harry Potter. And give Rowling the chance to showcase a younger Dumbledore and possibly delve into his backstory (both with Grindenwald and his sis) that was so sadly cut out of much of the last Potter films.",UCmET6DwQWb6TPOVPpEOUKYQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmET6DwQWb6TPOVPpEOUKYQ,0,,,-0.3995

Unfortunately man has not yet learned that animals should not be tormented for being &quot;fantastic&quot;. And this film encourages people to &quot;find&quot; animals ... And also the possibility to exploit them (emotionally or otherwise) in any way. Like Pokemon trivialize the act of hunting animals and put them to fight against each other for fun because &quot;men&quot; have the right to harass animals. Fantastic Beasts follows the same disguised thought of &quot;innocent story for children.&quot; A terrible disguise thought of Innocence.

Were introduced to a new character named Newt Scamander; who is a graduate of Hogwarts and was a member of Hufflepuff, ( the house part isnt important but I found out he came from Hufflepuff on Pottermore) and we follow him as he arrives in america with a case full of magical creatures as were also intorduced to how the magical world is in the U.S. aside from in Europe. The film is set to be the first of a trilogy with J.K Rowling in her screen wrighting debut, and be directed by David Yates who directed some of the later Harry Potter films. So yeah, sorry if this is long for you.

To me, Grave is what Snape was in Philosopher's Stone or what Malfoy was in Chamber of secret or Sirius in prisonner of Azkaban ( Even Umbridge was one of these with Harry's scar hurting when he was close to her): The ideal suspect, the one we suspect during the whole book/movie because he or she has something about him that make him a suspect with Snape was awful with the students;Malfoy was a bully, Sirius just escaped of Azkaban and Umbridge was just herself ( she doesn't need any other reason to be a suspect except for being herself ) but it turn out, it's not him or her... Maybe it's someone else completely and Graves is just the guy who look suspect and say creepy things during the whole movie (and has a reason for it in the end) and we discover it's someone else completely that we didn't see coming like Peter or Barty Croupton or even Tom Riddle in Chamber..",UCssEKCh3ti7xLbD6kZ5NAmg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCssEKCh3ti7xLbD6kZ5NAmg,1,UghVXepyeT2wbHgCoAEC,Van Strumpfkolben,-0.6409

I think his original plan was to unite wizardkind and declare war on the whole non-magical population, but the most wizarding gouvernments disagreed with his goals, which led to the wizarding war. In order to fulfill his vision of a united wizard ""race"" fighting against all non-magical humans, he came up with a plan: Revealing the existence of a wizard community in one of the most military advanced and wizard-phobic nations in the world: the USA. A country which has already a well established anti-wizard organziation (the so called ""New Salem Philantropic Society"") and the military resources to fight a world war! Moreover, Scamander's visit is the perfect opportunity to hide their actions. In other words: The perfect place and time to create a starting point for a global war between wizardkind and non-magical people. The arrival of Newt Scmanader and his special suitcase plays a key role in his plan, because he can be used to make the reveal of North America's wizard community look like an accident. Is it logical that an enchanted suitcase, full of dangerous, magical creatures can be accidently(!) opened by a No-Maj(!) in one of the greatest non-magical cities? How can it be that his suitcase is not magically sealed? What if the creatures were meant to escape and to rampage through the city in order to draw attention to the secret, magcal world? This could be the perfect plot twist: Scmanders suitcase was magically prepared by Grindelwalds agents to let the creatures escape soon after his arrival in New York. In the second half of the movie, Scamander, who is blamed for letting the creatures escape, the Goldstein sisters and Jacob find out that Percival Graves, who plays the role of the law-abiding auror is actually one of Grindelwalds followers who tries to initiate the violent conflict between the North America's wizarding and and non-magical population. At some point of the movie, Picquery, the president of MACUSA and her aurors will assist Scamander, after Graves true nature is revealed by Scmanader or himself. Hints for Graves role as the major anatgonist can be found in serval parts of the trailer: 1:18 ""We (wizards or the Scourer's descendants) lived in the shadows for too long"". 2:05 ""I refuse to bow down any longer"" 2:11 ""I ask all of you.

Should we call them muggle or no maj ? ) and magical people right ? (and you are right it would go with Grindewald's idiology...) So basically you think that a war will happened but that MACUSA actually will erase the memory of every No maj/muggles involved afterward right ? because I like this but how come it was never mentioned in Harry Potter series? A war between wizard and muggles seems rather huge especially because it could be important to Voldemort as well so I'm still not sure about that... Maybe it just an attempt to actually start a war which will fail Do we know the actual real start of the war between Grindelwald and Dumbledore ? Maybe this film is just the start.. Grindelwald is here and dangerous but it's not a war yet ! You know what I mean ? The attempt to create the war between this two communities which will be stopped by Newt and MACUSA will be the starting point of the war between only wizards !

After the creatures are captured and the crisis is over, MACUSA will repair the damage and erase the No-Maj's memories. In the eye of non-magical history, these events never happened. Since Grindelwald was mentioned in the trailer, I assume that his people cooperate with the Scourer's descendents to plan this scenario. They could try to use this opportunity to initiate conflict between North America's magical and non-magical population. A conflict which serves as a starting point and justification for a wordlwide war against non-magical humans. This would fit perfectly into Grindelwald's idiology, in which wizards should declare war on no-majs/muggles and end their rule over the world.
