    "Left wing mediaplatform are The Guardian and BBC, right Yahoo News and The Wall Street Journals. Firstly, i compare reactions of love in both sides. The distribution diagram shows a similar trend from both perspectives. Between ratio values in 5 to 15, there are more reactions to love in left wing controlled media platform. Secondly, i look into the hate reactions, which is prescibed in green and red line in the gram. We can notice that the density of left wing media platform is much greater than it in right. Therefore, we can conclude that the occurence of reactions of hate is more frequently seen in left-major media. Thirdly, the sad reaction has been analysed. The purple line, representing sad reactions from lefties undergoes below the blown one, which the latter represents sadness from righties. The tendency demonstrates that in the value between 0 to 15, less sadness reactions are posted in left-dominanted media. \n",
